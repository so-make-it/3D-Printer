This Repo will eventually contain all design and configuration information for the So Make It RepRap. (work in progress)

The So Make It RepRap is on long term loan by Chris3DSmith to the makerspace for everybody to learn and experience 3D printing.

The printer is based on the Ecksbot design by EckerTech (based on the Prusa i2) and all information was originally forked from their repo here:
https://github.com/eckertech/Ecksbot
